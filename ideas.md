# Numbers Game Ideas

## Adjectives

- Impatient - When played first, double value.
- Jealous - Destroys all other cards with the same value.
- Extroverted - Add 1 for each other card in row.
- Row effects like lowest number in this row wins?
- Stealing cards?
- Or just give a pool of like 12 adjs and players pick but you don't know which they picked. Or 6 with 3 distributed randomly but you can always check which 6 might exist. Or 12 or whatever.
- What if turn selection alternated Num Adj, so for example you ight be forced to pick a negative adjective?
- Copy an adjective

## General

- Should there be six adjectives which are in the middle that both players can see and choose from?
- What if the players had total perfect information? They could also see each other's numbers. Or, split it and have numbers hidden but must be between 0-9 (or 1-9), but adjectives are shared. Or, each could have a pool of three adjectives. But I like the idea of some portion of the game not relying on memorizing an entire pool of cards like in Gwent. I like the idea of each game containing a self-referential strategy. Each game a dense cube.
- Should there be a rarity? If it's very rare, everyone will want to get it so there has to be a huge downside.
  -What if you could add numbers to their rows, but then they would also have the option of putting adjectives on that number? Then you could destroy cards in your own row if they had negative adjectives.
- Positions so cards coul face each other?
- Should there be drawing? Probably not if limited turns.
- How much emphasis on math? Should it be a math game or a strategy game?
